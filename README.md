# VbPcre2
PCRE2 Regular Expression (Regex) Library Wrapper for Visual Basic 6 (VB6)

This software is completely experimental at this point, and not recommended for any use.

The goal is to have a comprehensive wrapper for PCRE2 in an ActiveX DLL for use in VB6 or other COM supporting languages.

You can get a compatible binary copy of the PCRE2 stdcall DLL here: https://github.com/tannerhelland/PCRE2-VB6-DLL/releases
